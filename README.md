# sales-forecasting

This is a model that helps in predicting the sales that a company can achieve in the coming months using past months' data. 

**Utilisation of UPGini**  
Point to be noted here is that there are not a lot of parameters in the data file so the user is to acquire more parameters to make a good model. This is done UPGini through which you get public data on weather, economic date, event date, etc.
This helps in getting more parameters to be considered for the model and thus creating a better model.

**To my future self**  
My very first project. As a clueless rookie entering the world of ML, this project is what got me hands on experience on ML and made me understand the implementation of the theory I knew till then. Thank you to the YouTube tutor!
